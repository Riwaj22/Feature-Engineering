# Feature-Engineering


Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into a set of meaningful features that can be used by machine learning algorithms to improve their performance in solving a specific task or problem. It involves selecting, extracting, and creating relevant features from the available data to enhance the predictive power of the models.

The quality and relevance of the features used in machine learning models significantly impact their performance. Feature engineering aims to highlight the underlying patterns and relationships in the data by representing it in a more suitable and informative way.
